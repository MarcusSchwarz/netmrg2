=======

NetMRG is a database-driven network
monitoring and graphing tool for use on Linux systems. It
offers an intuitive web-based configuration, customized
monitoring capabilities for unusual situations, a fast
multi-threaded polling application, and brilliant graphs
rendered by RRDTOOL.

NetMRG was originally developed by Brady Alleman and Douglas E. Warner

It was abandoned early 2008


netmrg2 will keep the spirit and simplicity of NetMRG.

The main focus of the project lies in the adaption of language changes in PHP,
and in adding some tweaks to improve the usability of netmrg.
